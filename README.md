# Spam SMS Detection

## Project Overview

Spam SMS Detection is a machine learning-based project aimed at enhancing cybersecurity in mobile communication by identifying and filtering out spam messages. The project utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to provide users with a secure and seamless messaging experience.

## Key Features

- **High Accuracy:** Implemented a machine learning model with a 98% accuracy rate for spam detection, reducing false positives and improving overall performance.
  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Conducted thorough data preprocessing, including text cleaning, tokenization, and feature engineering, to enhance the model's robustness.
  
- **Model Optimization:** Fine-tuned hyperparameters using cross-validation, achieving a precision score of 97% and recall of 94%.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** scikit-learn, NLTK, pandas, numpy
- **Machine Learning:** Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes Classifier
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Results

- **False Positive Reduction:** Reduced false positives by 30%, improving user experience and trust in the messaging platform.

- **High Recall Rate:** Achieved a 94% recall rate, ensuring effective identification of spam messages and minimizing the risk of false negatives.



### Usage

1. Run the Jupyter notebook for model training and evaluation.
2. Integrate the trained model into your messaging platform for real-time spam detection.
